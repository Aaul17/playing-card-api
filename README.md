# Playing Cards API

This is the API for the Playing Cards Program. To find the frontend for the project, click on the following link: https://github.com/Aaul17/playing-card-frontend. Be sure to run the API prior to running the frontend.

We are assuming that you already have Ruby 2.3.7 installed. In order to correctly get this API running, please follow the below steps:

* Clone this repo to your computer.

* Open Terminal and navigate to the program's main directory folder.

* Make sure to 'bundle install' to install all of the program's gems and then run 'rails db:migrate && rails db:seed'.

* Last but not least, type 'rails s' to start up the API. It should be running through port 3000.
